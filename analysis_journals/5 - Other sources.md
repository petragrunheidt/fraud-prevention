  The scope of this project is limited to the dataset of the csv file, but there are plenty of other data that can be absolutely significative in fraud analysis

## User history

  User history was something challenging to analyze in this dataset, since the data set is small and there are'nt that many repeating customers, but it is usually a full plate of elements that can be used to strongly predict if a transaction is fraudulent. Here are a few examples:

- Location data: If a user is performing a transaction from a new or unusual location, this can be a strong indicator of fraud. With cellphones and geolocation, itâ€™s easier than ever to verify if a transaction is being made from an expected location.
- Purchase behaviour: In this dataset, we examined the transaction amount as a whole, but the same thing could have been done for each individual user. Also, if we could have data about the merchant the user usually goes for that could be another element to predict fraud
- Days of the week: For individual users, understanding their typical shopping patterns, such as which days of the week they usually make purchases, can be a strong indicator of whether a transaction is legitimate or not.
